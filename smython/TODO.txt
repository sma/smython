1. General

* no builtin functions, no builtin modules  
* scanner & parser simply abort on errors
* no exception hierarchy 
* code was written against 1.4 spec, 1.6 spec is new goal

2. Lexical Analysis

* scanner allows spaces or comments after trailing \ (extension)
* everything is considered to be unicode
* no complex numbers

3. Data Model

* no id() builtin function
* no type() builtin function
* try/except doesn't work correctly
* no __members__ or __methods__ attributes
* no Ellipsis type and no ... object
* no floats, no complex numbers
* no explicit unicode string, instead normal string is UTF-16
* no len() builtin function
* no docstrings for any kind of function, method or class
* functions and methods lack most special attributes
* classes most lack special attributes
* module objects are not implemented at all
* no file objects
* code objects are not supported (internal object, I use AST Nodes)
* frame objects only rudimentary
* no traceback objects
* no slice objects 
* no right-side __rXX__ methods, no __coerce__
* coercion rule not implemented

4. Execution model

* no exec, execfile(), eval() or input()
* no builtin namespace, no support for globals
* no __builtin__ namespace
* no __main__ namespace
* exceptions can be raised and caught but exception hierarchy is non-existant

5. Expressions

* arithmetic conversions (coercion rules) not implemented
* no private name mangling
* extended slicing not implemented (I didn't understand what to do)
* assigning to tuple parameter in functions doesn't work
* never checked whether % is correctly implemented
* no divmod() builtin function
* negative shift counts do not raise exception (extension)
* < or > for objects of different type compare hash values! (simulating pointer comparison)

6. Simple statements

* assert does not check for __debug__
* assign to nested tuples never tested - probably doesn't work
* assignment only works with tuples as defined by Python 1.4, relaxed rules not supported
* del: not tested
* print: str() implementation is incomplete
* raise: two or three argument variant do not work
* import: not supported
* global: ignored, doesn't work with the current way the parser constructs the AST
* exec: not supported
* no multiple assignments

7. Compound statements

* try/except doesn't support exception hierarchy
* no sys.exc_type, sys.exc_traceback, etc.
* functions with tuple parameter names can be defined but not correctly called
* functions have no name
* classes have no name

8. Toplevel components

* cannot execute files
* no eval(), execfile() or input() builtin functions
