= Todo list of open issues =

== 1. General ==

 * no builtin functions, no builtin modules  
 * scanner & parser simply abort on errors
 * no exception hierarchy 
 * code was written against 1.4 spec, 1.6 spec is new goal

== 2. Lexical Analysis ==

 * scanner ignores \t
 * scanner allows spaces or comments after trailing \ (extension)
 * no multiline strings
 * no string escapes
 * no rawstrings
 * everything is considered to be unicode
 * no floats, no complex numbers
 * no lowercase "l" for long integers allowed

== 3. Data Model ==

 * no id() builtin function
 * no type() builtin function
 * try/except doesn't work correctly
 * no {{{__}}}members{{{__}}} or {{{__}}}methods{{{__}}} attributes
 * no Ellipsis type and no ... object
 * no floats, no complex numbers
 * no explicit unicode string, instead normal string is UTF-16
 * no len() builtin function
 * no docstrings for any kind of function, method or class
 * functions and methods lack most special attributes
 * clases most lack special atttributes
 * module objects are not implemented at all
 * no file objects
 * code objects are not supported (internal object, I use AST Nodes)
 * frame objects only rudimentary
 * no traceback objects
 * no slice objects 
 * no right-side {{{__}}}rXX{{{__}}} methods, no {{{__}}}coerce{{{__}}}
 * coercion rule not implemented

== 4. Execution model ==

 * no exec, execfile(), eval() or input()
 * no builtin namespace, no support for globals
 * no {{{__}}}builtin{{{__}}} namespace
 * no {{{__}}}main{{{__}}} namespace
 * exceptions can be raised and caught but exeception hierarchy is non-existant

== 5. Expressions ==

 * arithmetic conversions (coercion rules) not implemented
 * no private name mangling
 * extended slicing not implementd (I didn't unstand what to do)
 * assigning to tuple parameter in functions doesn't work
 * never checked whether % is correctly implemented
 * no divmod() builtin function
 * negative shift counts do not raise exception (extension)
 * < or > for objects of different type compare hash values! (simulating pointer comparison)

== 6. Simple statements ==

 * assert does not check for {{{__}}}debug{{{__}}}
 * assign to nested tuples never tested - probably doesn't work
 * assignment only works with tuples as defined by Python 1.4, relaxed rules not supported
 * del: not tested
 * print: str() implementation is incomplete
 * raise: two or three argument variant do not work
 * import: not supported
 * global: ignored, doesn't work with the current way the parser constructs the AST
 * exec: not supported

== 7. Compound statements ==

 * try/except doesn't support exception hierarchy
 * no sys.exc_type, sys.exc_traceback, etc.
 * functions with tuple parameter names can be defined but not correctly called
 * functions have no name
 * classes have no name

== 8. Toplevel components ==

 * cannot execute files
 * no eval(), execfile() or input() builtin functions
